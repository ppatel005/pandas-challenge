Analyzing the data:
  For this assignment, I noticed that the average of all 15 schools combined was decent for both reading and math, but there was some differences. I  noticed that the percentage of passing for both reading and math was higher when the school budgets were less while those schools that had a bigger budget, didn't do as well. I also noticed that smaller school sizes did better then those schools that had a lot of students. What I took away from this data is that it didn't matter if the school had the money in the end, bc the students didn't do as well. 
Resources:
I used resources such as the help of my TA, Mark with some of the codes, as well as online resources to help me troubleshoot code lining. I also had some help with tutors and askBCS.
